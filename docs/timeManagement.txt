Automated Note to Ian and rashid

Hi Syed and Rashid,

For our project time tracking, we have been using an Excel sheet stored in our GitLab repository, which is linked through the school website.

I have shared the file with both of you via email. During our project presentation, we will include a screenshot of the time log and briefly walk through how we managed our time throughout the project.

If you run into any issues accessing the file, please let me know. I wonâ€™t be available as I wll be working on my JavaFX/Swing GUI project for COMP 3220 (Object-Oriented Design & Object Oriented Analysis).

Thanks!
